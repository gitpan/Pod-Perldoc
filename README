			       Perldoc

This is an experimental distribution of Perldoc, the program for
reading Pod documentation.

NOTE: the binary that this dist installs is currently called perldoc3,
and the documentation for it is called perldoc3 too.  So when you see
"run 'perldoc perldoc'", you should actually run "perldoc3 perldoc3".



INSTALLATION

You install this module-suite, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of this module-suite in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

See perldoc perlmodinstall for more information on installing modules.
