This is the distribution of Perldoc, the program for reading Pod
documentation.


INSTALLATION

You install this module-suite, as you would install any perl module
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of this module-suite in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/perl

See perldoc perlmodinstall for more information on installing modules.
