Revision history for Perl module group Pod::Perldoc
                                        Time-stamp: "2003-07-24 06:33:17 ADT"

2003-07-24  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 3.09.
	
	Notable changes:
	
	* perldoc when run as root no longer dies when it can't manage to
	drop privileges.  This is by popular demand.
	* perldoc -f -X now properly sees an -X entry regardless of
	whether it's coded as =item -X or =item I<-X>.
	* In README, changed "This is an experimental distribution of
	Perldoc," to "This is the distribution of Perldoc,"

	Wee little things:
	
	* Added a "use 5.006;" to the start of Perldoc.pm and the
	Makefile.PL, since we do actually need that version of perl
	for the module to even compile right.  (Altho backporting is an
	option later, if we remove the 5.6-isms.)
	* Perldoc.pm has a new constant IS_Cygwin if we ever need it.
	* Added a bit of IS_VMS logic.
	* Minor cosmetic changes to handling of -U.
	* Added a few comments here and there.
	
2003-01-18  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 3.08.
	* Fixed split-related bug in reading $Config{'pager'}.
	Thanks to Chip Turner <cturner@redhat.com> for pointing it out!

2002-12-01  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 3.07.
	* Minor typo fix to code in Pod::Perldoc::ToMan.
	* Added RTFREADER example to Pod::Perldoc::ToRTF docs.
	* Made Pod::Perldoc::ToTk a bit more tolerant of old Tk::Pod
	versions (pre-4.0).	

2002-11-22  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Release 3.06.

	previously documented only in perldoc -h
	
	* Many thanks to David Hand, Avi Finkel, Iain "Spoon" Truskett,
	Conrad Heiney, Casey West, Pete Sergeant, David Dyck, Michael
